The current president is Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has effectively controlled the country since the 2013 coup d'état, and was officially elected president in 2014.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nThe first president of Egypt was Mohamed Naguib, one of the leaders of the Free Officers Movement who led the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, and who took office on 18 June 1953, the day on which Egypt was declared a republic. Since then the office has been held by five further people: Gamal Abdel Nasser, Anwar Sadat, Hosni Mubarak, Mohamed Morsi and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. In addition, Sufi Abu Taleb acted as president between Sadat's assassination and Mubarak's election as his successor, and Adly Mansour acted as president after Morsi's overthrow in the 2013 coup d'état.\\nFollowing Mubarak's resignation on 11 February 2011 in the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, the office was vacant, with the functions of head of state and head of government being discharged by the chairman of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), Field Marshal Muhammad Hussein Tantawy.\\nMorsi took office on 30 June 2012, after being elected by the presidential election held on 23–24 May and 16–17 June 2012. He was deposed by the Egyptian Armed Forces in a coup d'état on 3 July 2013, following massive protests calling for his resignation. He was succeeded by Mansour, the head of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt, as Acting President. Mansour was sworn into office in front of the Supreme Constitutional Court on 4 July 2013.\\nCurrent President el-Sisi took office on 8 June 2014, after being elected by the presidential election held on 26–28 May 2014. He was re-elected twice (by the presidential election held on 26–28 March 2018 and by the presidential election held on 10–12 December 2023).\\n\\n\\n== List of officeholders ==\\nPolitical parties\\n\\nOther affiliations\\n\\nStatus\\n\\nSymbols\\nP  Presidential referendum\\nCT  Constitutional and term extension referendum\\n†  Died in office\\n\\n\\n== Timeline ==\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nMuhammad Ali dynasty\\nList of monarchs of the Muhammad Ali dynasty\\nPresident of Egypt\\nVice President of Egypt\\nPrime Minister of Egypt\\nList of prime ministers of Egypt\\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives (Egypt)\\nList of speakers of the House of Representatives (Egypt)\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Citations ===\\n\\n\\n=== Sources ===\",\n",

He was a professor of chemistry and physics at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he was the first Caltech faculty member to be named the Linus Pauling Chair of Chemical Physics and served as the director of the Physical Biology Center for Ultrafast Science and Technology.\n",

      "Ahmed Hassan Zewail was born on February 26, 1946, in Damanhur, Egypt, and was raised in Desouk. He received Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in chemistry from Alexandria University before moving to the United States to complete his PhD at the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of Robin M. Hochstrasser.\n",

Following this, he was awarded a faculty appointment at the California Institute of Technology in 1976, and eventually became the first Linus Pauling Chair in Chemical Physics there. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States on March 5, 1982. Zewail was the director of the Physical Biology Center for Ultrafast Science and Technology at the California Institute of Technology.\n",

      "Ahmed Hassan Zewail was born on February 26, 1946, in Damanhur, Egypt, and was raised in Desouk. He received Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in chemistry from Alexandria University before moving to the United States to complete his PhD at the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of Robin M. Hochstrasser.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Career ==\n",
      "After completing his PHD, Zewail did postdoctoral research at the University of California, Berkeley, supervised by Charles B. Harris. Following this, he was awarded a faculty appointment at the California Institute of Technology in 1976, and eventually became the first Linus Pauling Chair in Chemical Physics there. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States on March 5, 1982. Zewail was the director of the Physical Biology Center for Ultrafast Science and Technology at the California Institute of Technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zewail was nominated and participated in President Barack Obama's Presidential Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), an advisory group of the nation's leading scientists and engineers to advise the President and Vice President and formulate policy in the areas of science, technology, and innovation.\n",
      "{'document_title': 'Ahmed Zewail'}\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "== Research ==\n",
      "Zewail's key work was a pioneer of femtochemistry—i.e. the study of chemical reactions across femtoseconds. Using a rapid ultrafast laser technique (consisting of ultrashort laser flashes), the technique allows the description of reactions on very short time scales – short enough to analyse transition states in selected chemical reactions. \n",
      "Zewail became known as the \"father of femtochemistry\". He also made critical contributions in ultrafast electron diffraction, which uses short electron pulses rather than light pulses to study chemical reaction dynamics.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Political work ==\n",
      "In a speech at Cairo University on June 4, 2009, US President Barack Obama proclaimed a new Science Envoy program as part of a \"new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world.\" In January 2010, Ahmed Zewail, Elias Zerhouni, and Bruce Alberts became the first US science envoys to the Muslim world, visiting Muslim-majority countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia.When asked about rumors that he might contest the 2012 Egyptian presidential election, Ahmed Zewail said: \"I am a frank man... I have no political ambition, as I have stressed repeatedly that I only want to serve Egypt in the field of science and die as a scientist.\"\n",
      "During the 2011 Egyptian protests he announced his return to the country. Zewail said that he would join a committee for constitutional reform alongside Ayman Nour, Mubarak's rival at the 2005 presidential elections and a leading lawyer.\n",
      "Zewail was later mentioned as a respected figure working as an intermediary between the military regime ruling after Mubarak's resignation, and revolutionary youth groups such as the April 6 Youth Movement and young supporters of Mohamed ElBaradei. He played a critical role during this time as described by Egyptian Media.\n",
