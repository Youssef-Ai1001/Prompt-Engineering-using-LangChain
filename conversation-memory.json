Here are three must-see destinations:\n\n1. The Pyramids of Giza: This is one of the most iconic attractions in Egypt, and it's definitely worth visiting. The pyramids were built around 2580 BC as tombs for the pharaohs, and they're an incredible feat of engineering. You can take a guided tour to learn more about the history and construction of the pyramids.\n2. The Valley of the Kings: Located on the west bank of the Nile River in Luxor, this is another important archaeological site that's worth visiting. The valley is home to the tombs of many pharaohs from ancient Egypt, including Tutankhamun. You can take a guided tour to learn more about the history and significance of each tomb.\n3. Islamic Cairo: This historic neighborhood in Cairo is filled with mosques, madrasas, and other Islamic monuments that date back to the Fatimid and Ottoman periods. Some popular attractions include the Mosque of Muhammad Ali, the Al-Azhar University, and the Khan el-Khalili market.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful!",
